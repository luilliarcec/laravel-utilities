## Set Attributes Uppercase

This section is for when you want to set all, or some of your attributes to uppercase.

#### Usage

```php
// ...
use Luilliarcec\Utilities\Concerns\SetAttributesUppercase;

class User extends Authenticable
{
    use SetAttributesUppercase;
}
```

If you want to ignore some attributes of your model, it can be set in the `dontApplyCase` property as follows.

```php
// ...
use Luilliarcec\Utilities\Concerns\SetAttributesUppercase;

class User extends Authenticable
{
    use SetAttributesUppercase;
    
    protected $dontApplyCase = [
        'username'
    ];
}    
```

If you want to ignore attributes globally, add them in the `utilities` config file under
the` attributes_ignored_globally` key.

## Belongs To Auth

This section is useful when you have tables in your DB model that are related to the authenticated user. By default, the
name 'user_id' is used as the foreign key for the relationship, but you can change it from the `utilities` configuration
file in the` auth_foreign_id_column` key.

You can use the `BelongsTo Auth` Trait.

1. This Trait will add a listener for the `creating` event to associate the authenticated user with the model in
   question when it is being created.
2. Also add a global scope to retrieve all the records associated with the authenticated user, you can disable this
   scope by calling the `withoutAuth` function when building your query.
3. In addition, a custom rule is available for the `exists` and` unique` rules that add the `where` condition for the
   authenticated user, for you. It can also concatenate more conditions and other functionalities of the base
   rules `exists` and` unique`.

#### Using Trait

```php
// ...
use Luilliarcec\Utilities\Concerns\BelongsToAuth;

class Invoice extends Model
{
    use BelongsToAuth;
}
```

#### Using withoutAuth function

```php
Invoice::withoutAuth()
    // ->where(...)
    ->get();
```

#### Using Rules

```php

use Luilliarcec\Utilities\Rules\Auth;

Request::validate([
    'invoice_id' => Auth::exists('invoices', 'id') // ->where(...)
]);
```

## Decimals Rule

If you want to check decimal numbers, and the number of decimal places, you can use this rule as follows.

```php
use Luilliarcec\Utilities\Rules\Decimals;

Request::validate([
    'amount' => new Decimals // by default they are 8 integers and 2 decimals
]);

Request::validate([
    'amount' => new Decimals(20, 4) // 20 integers and 4 decimals
]);
```

## Testing

``` bash
composer test
```
